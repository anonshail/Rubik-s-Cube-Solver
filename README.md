# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver
A rubik's cube solver that uses the blindfolded algorithm

At the moment, the program randomizes the shuffle algorithm (just to demonstrate how the program works), but, the program can be modified to accepnt an input shuffle algorithm, or the input state of the rubik's cube (in which case the program will be able to handle impossible cases too), and will be able to display the finaly output algorithm.
